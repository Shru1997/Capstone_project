Capstone Project based on Data Engineering Techniques:

Several Data Engineering techniques such as HDFS,Hive,Impala,SparkSQL,SparkML has been used in this project.

The main business objective of this project is to create end to end pipeline and analyse the data.
Build ML model using pyspark and creating ML pipeline.


The code for exploratory data analysis in Hive/Impala has been provided in capstoneproject.ipynb.
The code for SparkML has been provided in sparkml.ipynb which includes the pipeline creation code using Liner REgression.

This project consists of six dataset in CSV file.The dataset include employee,salary,titles,departments,dept_emp,dept_manager.The dataset file is in data folder.
