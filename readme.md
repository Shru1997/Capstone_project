Capstone Project based on Data Engineering Techniques:

Several Data Engineering techniques such as HDFS,Hive,Impala,SparkSQL,SparkML has been used in this project.

The main business objective of this project is to analyze why employees are leaving and reasons fro the same and also to create end to end pipeline by integrating all the Data Engineering technologies.
Build ML model using pyspark and creating ML pipeline to build predictive model where we are predicting which employees are going to leave the company.

This project consists of six dataset in CSV file.The dataset include employee,salary,titles,departments,dept_emp,dept_manager.The dataset file is in data folder.

The code for exploratory data analysis in Hive/Impala has been provided in capstoneproject.ipynb.
The code for SparkML has been provided in sparkml.ipynb which includes the pipeline creation code using Linear Regression.
